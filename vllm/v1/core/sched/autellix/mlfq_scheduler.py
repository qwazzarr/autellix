"""Program-agnostic FastServe-style multi-level feedback queue (MLFQ) scheduler.

MLFQ is the paper's call-level baseline (Autellix §4.2.2): it ignores program
identity entirely and schedules by each call's own accrued service. Every new
call enters the top queue Q1; it is demoted one level whenever it exhausts its
queue's decode-step quantum; a call that waits too long relative to its service
is promoted back to Q1 (anti-starvation); and when the running batch is full a
higher-priority waiting call proactively preempts the worst running call. This is
the FastServe scheme the paper builds on, realised on the vLLM v1 engine by
composing the shared quantum/promotion machinery (:class:`QuantumMlfqMixin`)
with vLLM's native priority queue and recompute-based preemption.

Mapping (see ``notes/autellix_scheduling/POLICY_REFERENCE.md`` §3-5):

* "Queue index" maps directly to ``request.priority`` (Q1 == priority 0 ==
  highest; a larger priority is a lower queue). The native
  ``PriorityRequestQueue`` then orders waiting calls by
  ``(priority, arrival_time, request_id)``, and the base scheduler's reactive
  KV-pressure victim ``max(running, key=(priority, arrival_time))`` is already
  the worst (most-demoted) running call.
* Service is engine wall time (D2): each scheduled step charges its measured
  duration to every co-scheduled call, prefill chunks included. No cumulative
  :class:`AttainedServiceTracker` is needed here because the per-call service
  window is the anti-starvation ``T`` and is reset on promotion.
* All state is strictly **per call** (there is no process table); the
  anti-starvation ratio uses the call-level windows alone (``W_c / max(1,
  T_c)``), the paper's deliberately "naive" FastServe variant -- the mixin's
  ``_program_windows`` default of ``(0, 0)``. State is released on both normal
  completion and external abort so nothing leaks.

Constants: ``K = 7`` queues, per-queue quanta in seconds of service
``(1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64)`` (the paper's cited FastServe geometric ×2 scheme,
now wall-time so it matches PLAS/ATLAS through the mixin), and anti-starvation
ratio ``beta = 8.0``. Magnitudes are calibration (not paper-mandated); they are
exposed as constructor parameters so a ``beta`` / ``K`` ablation is possible.

Proactive preemption + thrash bound: v1 never preempts a running call to admit a
higher-priority waiting one (it only preempts reactively on KV OOM), so the
mixin adds this in a bookkeeping pass run *before* delegating to
``super().schedule()``. To avoid preempt/recompute thrash it preempts at most
``max_proactive_preemptions_per_step`` calls per step (default 1, matching the
paper's "preempt the worst running call"), and only ever the current worst
running call while a waiting call *strictly* outranks it — so once the queues
converge (no waiting call outranks any running call) preemption stops.
