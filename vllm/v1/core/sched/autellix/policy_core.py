"""Shared quantum / demotion / promotion machinery for the Autellix schedulers.

Algorithm 1 of the paper runs the same per-call mechanics for every policy
(MLFQ baseline, PLAS, ATLAS): each call holds a discretized priority level with
a per-level quantum in **seconds of service** (D3); exhausting the quantum
demotes the call one level; a waiting call accrues wait, and once its
wait-to-service ratio reaches ``beta`` it is promoted back to the top level with
its *call-level* windows reset; and when the batch is full a strictly-better
waiting call proactively preempts the worst running call (bounded per step,
recompute-based). Attained service is measured as engine wall time: each
scheduled step charges its measured duration to every co-scheduled call,
prefill chunks included (the paper's execution-time definition, ``e_i``).

The policies differ only in the *windows* fed to the anti-starvation ratio:

* MLFQ (FastServe baseline) uses the call-level windows alone
  (``W_c / max(1, T_c)``) -- the paper's deliberately "naive" variant.
* PLAS / ATLAS use **program-level** starvation (paper §4.2.2):
  ``(W_p + W_c) / max(1, T_p + T_c)``, where ``W_p``/``T_p`` come from the
  process table (PLAS: service sum; ATLAS: critical-path max). Only the
  call-level windows reset on promotion, so a program's calls promote together
  and the program cannot be re-starved by its own promotion.

Priority encoding (shared by all three schedulers): ``request.priority`` is the
call's current queue level, an int in ``[0, K-1]`` with 0 the top queue, so
``Request.__lt__``'s int-priority semantics are untouched. The native
``PriorityRequestQueue`` orders by ``(priority, arrival_time, request_id)`` --
level primary, FCFS within a level. Program attained service influences only
the *arrival* level (PLAS/ATLAS bin the program scalar); demotion and promotion
then move the level in place, exactly as Algorithm 1 moves calls between
queues.

This module hosts the mechanics as a mixin over ``AsyncScheduler`` subclasses;
the schedulers keep their own arrival binning, program folding, and state
release. It relies on base-scheduler attributes (``waiting``,
``skipped_waiting``, ``running``, ``requests``, ``max_num_running_reqs``,
``_preempt_request``) and must precede ``AsyncScheduler`` in the MRO.
