"""Per-program scheduling state for the Autellix policies.

A *program* is one multi-step agentic workflow invocation that issues many LLM
calls. The scheduler groups calls by ``program_id`` and accumulates the
program's attained service and critical-path scalars here so that program-aware
policies (PLAS, ATLAS) and anti-starvation logic can consult a single source of
truth. Service / critical-path / wait scalars are in **seconds of engine wall
time** (D3), folded from each call's measured accrual. The module is pure Python
with no vLLM/torch dependency.
