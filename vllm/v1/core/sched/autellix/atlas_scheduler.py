"""Program-aware critical-path Least-Attained-Service (ATLAS) scheduler.

ATLAS is the multi-threaded generalisation of PLAS (paper §4.2, Eq. 2 +
Algorithm 1 line 3). Like PLAS it groups a program's many LLM calls (keyed by
``program_id``) and schedules least-served programs first, but the program's
scalar is its **maximum critical path** rather than the cumulative sum of call
service. This keeps a program's *parallel* threads on an equal footing: their
concurrent calls all inherit the same scalar, share a priority bin, and so a
straggler thread does not starve its siblings.

It differs from ``PLASScheduler`` in exactly two places
(``notes/autellix_scheduling/POLICY_REFERENCE.md`` §2):

* the program scalar consulted on arrival (and as ``T_p`` in the
  anti-starvation ratio) is ``ProgramState.max_critical_path`` (not
  ``.service``); and
* each call **snapshots** that scalar at arrival as its *start priority* and,
  on completion, folds it back with the max rule
  ``max_critical_path = max(max_critical_path, start_priority + call_service)``
  (not the PLAS sum ``service += call_service``).

Key faithfulness note: ATLAS needs **no explicit parent/DAG tracking**. The
single scalar plus start-priority inheritance approximates the program's
critical path, because concurrent calls naturally snapshot the same scalar at
arrival and the max rule then records only the longest thread. ``thread_id`` is
therefore purely optional observability metadata -- it is captured when present
but never influences a scheduling decision. With no concurrency (sequential
calls) every call inherits the full scalar left by its predecessor, the max rule
always increases, and ATLAS degrades exactly to PLAS's cumulative sum.

Deployment note: because ATLAS is a strict *generalization* of PLAS (the "A" is
"Adaptive") that reduces to it for single-threaded programs, the paper deploys a
single adaptive scheduler -- this one -- rather than choosing PLAS vs ATLAS per
program. There is no runtime detector in the paper (adding one would exceed it):
ATLAS alone handles both regimes. ``PLASScheduler`` and ``MLFQScheduler`` are
retained as separate ``--scheduler-cls`` choices only for our ablations that
isolate the sum rule from the critical-path max rule; the faithful "Autellix"
baseline is ATLAS.

Mapping to the vLLM v1 engine mirrors PLAS (see its module docstring and
POLICY_REFERENCE.md §6a): the arrival bin of the critical-path scalar is
written to ``request.priority`` (an int queue level, 0 = top), and Algorithm
1's per-call mechanics (via :class:`QuantumMlfqMixin`) layer on top -- quantum
demotion one level at a time, program-level anti-starvation promotion at
``(W_p + W_c) / max(1, T_p + T_c) >= beta`` with only the call-level windows
reset, and bounded proactive preemption at a full batch. Attained service is
engine wall time (each co-scheduled step charges its measured duration, prefill
chunks included, D2); on completion a call folds its critical path with the max
rule and its residual wait window into the program's ``W_p``.
